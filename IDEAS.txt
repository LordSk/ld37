LD37: One Room

One simple tiledmap
Several enemies, one boss
Skeleton-type enemies
Boss is a flying snake skeleton
	with stones spread evenly on its body
	each stone destroyed = dead boss
	main stone on its head. When the head stone is glowing, other stones are locked
	-> focus head for a bit, destroy body stones, head re-locks, repeat.

Death == loosing == winning
When dying or winning (boss dead), main character falls asleep and immediatly wakes up
In the same room, like waking up from a dream.

Randomize enemy spawns, give player another weapon ?



3 Skeleton enemies:
	normal with a sword
	normal with a bow
	big one with a shield
	

Player health: 2
Each hit is one health
Heal before boss? Drink "Wake up chalice" to heal -> summons boss
